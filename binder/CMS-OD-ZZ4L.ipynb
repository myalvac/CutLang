    "# ZZ to 4 leptons analysis with CMS open data and ADL/CutLang\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exercise showing a simple analysis exploring the ZZ -> 4 lepton final state, focusing on the e+e-μ+μ- channel.  The analysis aims to explore the kinematics of ZZ --> e+e-μ+μ- events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is performed based on CMS open data MC ntuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis consists of two parts:\n",
    "1. Applying some event selection to the input events and making distributions.  This part is performed using a special language called ADL, and via a software called CutLang that can read and process ADL.\n",
    "2. Drawing plots produced by the previous step.  This part is performed using ROOT (with Python syntax).  ROOT is the main analysis software used at CERN.\n"

    "## What are ADL and CutLang?\n",
    "\n",
    "(More information on [cern.ch/adl](cern.ch/adl))\n",
    "\n",
    "LHC data analyses are usually performed using complex analysis frameworks written in general purpose languages like C++ and python. \n",
    "But this method has a steep learning curve, as even the simplest tasks could be coded in a complicated way, and it is not straightforward to understand the code, make changes or additions.\n",
    "However there is another emerging alternative which allows to decouple physics content from the technical code and write analyses with a simple, self-describing syntax.  **Analysis Description Language (ADL)** is a HEP-specific analysis language developed with this purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "A HEP analysis includes 3 main parts:\n",
    "  * Object definitions: Which objects are used? e.g. electrons? muons? jets?  What are the selections applied on these?\n",
    "  * Event variable definitions: Are there event-wide variables used such as a invariant mass or a transverse mass?  How are they calculated?\n",
    "  * Event selections: What selections do we apply on events, for example, to enhance the signal and reduce the backgrounds?  Are there more than one event selections?  How are they defined?\n",
    "\n",
    "ADL consists of blocks separating object, variable and event selection definitions for a clear separation of analysis components. Blocks have a keyword-expression structure. Keywords specify analysis concepts and operations.  Syntax includes mathematical and logical operations, comparison and optimization operators, reducers, 4-vector algebra and HEP-specific functions (dφ, dR, …).\n",
    "\n",
    "ADL is designed with the goal to be self-describing, so especially for simple cases like in this example, one does not need to read syntax rules to understand an ADL description.  However if you are interested, the set of syntax rules can be found [here]( https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCPhysics/ADL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an analysis is written it needs to be run on events.  This is achieved by **CutLang** , the runtime interpreter who reads and understands the ADL syntax and runs it on events.  CutLang is also a framework which aturomatically handles many tedious tasks as reading input events, writing output histograms, etc.  CutLang can be run on various environments such as linux, mac, conda, docker, jupyter, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are interested to learn more on CutLang, please see the [CutLang github](https://github.com/unelg/CutLang)\n"

    "\n",
    "**Writing the analysis with ADL:** In the following cell, part of the analysis is written using the ADL syntax.  However there are some parts missing. Please follow the instructions in the comments to complete the missing parts.  If you feel adventurous, you could modify the object or event selections, add new variables or new histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running the analysis with CutLang:** Executing the cell will run the analysis on both the signal (SMHiggsToZZTo4L.root) and background (ZZTo2e2mu.root) events.  The run parameters are given in the first line of the cell:\n",
    "  * file : input root file\n",
    "  * filetype : input event format (do not change!)\n",
    "  * adlfile : the name we use for labeling the analysis \n",
    "  * events : number of events used from each file\n",
    "  * verbose : frequency of processed event numbers written in output text\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: When running jupyter/binder via direct link, if your run does not complete due to memory issues, please reduce the number of events via the \"events\" parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis output:** Running the analysis will produce two outputs:\n",
    "  * Text output shown cell output: This includes \"cutflows\" for each region, i.e. the selections applied and how many events survive the various selections.  Histograms are also listed.  You should see a separate output for each ROOT file that is run.\n",
    "  * ROOT output: One ROOT file called histoOut-\\<adlfile name\\>-\\<file name\\>.root that includes all the histograms produced by the analysis.  These ROOT files will be used in the next step."
